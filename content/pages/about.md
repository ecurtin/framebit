Title: About
Date: 2018-11-01

I'm an artist, software engineer, former documentary film editor,
armchair meteorologist, and monster truck enthusiast.
My top three favorite movies are Badlands (1973), Network (1976), and Furious 7 (2015).
I live in Atlanta, GA, my hometown and the best city in the world.

I'm a wife, little sister, and friend to some pretty cool people.
Here are just a few of them that also happen to have websites:

- **[Ryan Curtin:](http://ratml.org/)** my husband, machine learning researcher and adventure captain
- **[Andy Freeman:](http://andyfreemanaudio.com/)** my big brother, music producer and mix engineer
- **[Lindsay Thompson:](http://www.suchtalltales.com/)** director of Travel Light
- **[Thalea Stokes:](http://chicago.academia.edu/ThaleaStokes)** classical bass, ethnomusicologist
- **[Nathan Connelly:](http://nconnelly.com/)** storyboard artist for animation and D-list celebrity in Japan
- **[Elaine Mayes:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Mayes)** photographer and mentor
- **[Elizabeth Littauer:](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth_Littauer)** virologist and lover of mountains
- **[Somi Cowan:](http://somiyoon.com/)** developer and digital artist
- **[Rachel Lovins:](https://rachellovins.wordpress.com/)** mezzo-soprano and missionary
- **[Chad Kersey:](http://www.cdkersey.com/)** computer architect and general enthusiast
- **And many, many more** that don't have websites or Wikipedia pages that I can list here

The others are ranchers, writers, doctors, nurses, teachers, artists of all sorts, 
developers, engineers, nerds, designers, athletes, chefs, baby whisperers, farmers, 
city-slickers, mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, good drivers, ok drivers, 
terrible drivers, people who don't like to dance, and people who will dance the night away.
