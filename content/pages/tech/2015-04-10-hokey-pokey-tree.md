The HokeyPokeyTree is a generic binary tree structure useful for many different applications.

**Algorithmic Complexity**
- `O(n)` Access
- `O(n)` Search
- `O(n)` Insertion
- `O(n)` Deletion

**Structure Description**

The HokeyPokeyTree API gives users the ability to insert right child nodes, take right child nodes out,
insert right child nodes, and shake them all about. After insertion and removal and insertion of nodes,
the tree randomizes such that nodes are randomly assigned new parents and children.

Indeed, this is what it's all about.
