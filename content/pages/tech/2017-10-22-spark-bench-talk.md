spark-bench is an open-source benchmarking tool, and itâ€™s also so much more.

spark-bench is a flexible system for simulating, comparing, testing, and benchmarking 
Spark applications and Spark itself. spark-bench originally began as a benchmarking suite 
to get timing numbers on very specific algorithms mostly in the machine learning domain. 
Since then it has morphed into a highly configurable and flexible framework suitable for many use cases.

This talk will discuss the high level design and capabilities of spark-bench before 
walking through some major, practical use cases. Use cases include, but are certainly not 
limited to: 
- regression testing changes to Spark; 
- comparing performance of different hardware and Spark tuning options; 
- simulating multiple notebook users hitting a cluster at the same time; 
- comparing parameters of a machine learning algorithm on the same set of data; 
- providing insight into bottlenecks through use of compute-intensive and i/o-intensive workloads; 
- and, yes, even benchmarking. 

In particular this talk will address the use of spark-bench in developing new features features for Spark core.
