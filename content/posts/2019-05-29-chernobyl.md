Riding across the zone under the full moon, we'd stop sometimes and stare out at the woods and fields around us, all alone in the middle of that huge seeming expanse. 
The experience is full of tensions. 
It is so beautiful and so peaceful that it really feels like paradise, but it's a paradise that you can't enjoy. 
You have to be careful about where you sit, what you eat, how you eat it, what you touch; which is — ironically — why it exists. 
The reason it's so beautiful and so peaceful is precisely because we can't consume it. 
Like, perhaps, all real paradises everywhere.
