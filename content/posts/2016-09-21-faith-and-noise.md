We didnâ€™t go from faith to secularism in one fell swoop.... 
Certain ideas and practices made others not so much false as less vibrant or relevant. 
And so modernity slowly weakened spirituality, by design and accident, in favor of commerce; 
it downplayed silence and mere being in favor of noise and constant action. 
The reason we live in a culture increasingly without faith is not because science has somehow disproved the unprovable, 
but because the white noise of secularism has removed the very stillness in which it might endure or be reborn.
