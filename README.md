## Developing

This 10,001st iteration of this site is built using TailwindCSS because `#thefuture` and `#kidsthesedays`.

### Get ready to run NPM commands and feel a little gross about it (this is boilerplate from [create-vite-tailwind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-vite-tailwind) )

```
$ npm install
...
$ npm run dev
```

## Purged classes

Tailwind purges unused classes by default. This project is configured to scan HTML and 
JavaScript
 files in the root directory only. To change this behavior, edit the `content` property of `tailwind.config.cjs`. See the [Tailwind configuration docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) for more info.
