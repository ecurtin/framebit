My own little corner of the information super highway, or "World Wide Web" as kids call it these days. Dang millennials.

Once upon a time I used Wordpress. 
That time has passed, thank goodness, but now I'm slowly building back up to something prettier than raw HTML.

Currently I'm using a static HTML generator written in Scala with a fair number of SBT incantations called [Soapbox](https://github.com/ecurtin/Soapbox)
