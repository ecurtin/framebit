Last night I saw a cake in a 7/11 with "Merry Christmas" on it.
The toilet has as many buttons on it as the TV remote.
You can get any drink you want from a vending machine, but Lord help you if you want to throw away the bottle.

It's this gigantic city by a tranquil bay littered with elevation signs that warn of tsunamis.
It's a deep feeling of smallness to look out from a skyscraper and see this utterly endless exapanse of urban landscape, with the faintest hint of mountains on the horizon, for flavor.
It's the shock of being crunched in a Subway car with several hundred people and being able to hear the whisper of the old man's newspaper, as it's the only sound other than the train.

The silence. That's the shocking part. It seems to be all extremes here: either the sound is deafening, cacophonous, and exhausting, or you find yourself slipping down silent streets, fearful of breaking the tranquility with your own footsteps.
The arcades of Akahabara, the electric consumerism of Don Quijote, the crush and smell and pulsing of Takenshita Street in Harajuku on a Sunday. The pindrop peace of a park two or three blocks over, where the feel of a hundred thousand people shoving down a street seems like a crazy dream.
Be warned, no eating or drinking on the benches in that park. Or that one. Or that one. This whole city must be dehydrated.

Refinement and discipline. It's in the way the citizens of Tokyo dress, in the way they walk so precisely down the street, in the way they manage to maintain personal space while crushed on a train, in the fastidious cleanliness of every sidewalk, corner, and public toilet.
