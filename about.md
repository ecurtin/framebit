I am an artist, software engineer, former documentary film editor, 
armchair meteorologist, and monster truck enthusiast. 
This, surprisingly, is not actually a real picture of me.

I live in Atlanta, GA, my hometown and the best city in the world.

I am a wife, a little sister, and a friend to some pretty cool people.
Here are just a few of them that also happen to have websites:

- **[Ryan Curtin](http://ratml.org/)**, my husband, machine learning researcher and adventure captain
- **[Andy Freeman](http://andyfreemanaudio.com/)**, my big brother, music producer and mix engineer
- **[Lindsay Thompson](http://www.suchtalltales.com/)**, director of Travel Light
- **[Thalea Stokes](http://chicago.academia.edu/ThaleaStokes)**, classical bass, ethnomusicologist
- **[Nathan Connelly](http://nconnelly.com/)**, storyboard artist for animation and D-list celebrity in Japan
- **[Elaine Mayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Mayes)**, photographer and mentor
- **[Elizabeth Littauer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth_Littauer)**, virologist and lover of mountains
- **[Somi Cowan](http://somiyoon.com/)**, developer and digital artist
- **[Rachel Lovins](https://rachellovins.wordpress.com/)**, mezzo-soprano and missionary
- **[Chad Kersey](http://www.cdkersey.com/)**, computer architect and general enthusiast
- **And many, many more** that don't have websites I can list here

The others are ranchers, writers, doctors, nurses, teachers, artists of all sorts, 
developers, engineers, nerds, designers, athletes, chefs, baby whisperers, farmers, 
city-slickers, mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, good drivers, ok drivers, 
terrible drivers, people who don't like to dance, and people who will dance the night away.
