I am an artist, software engineer, armchair meteorologist, and monster truck enthusiast.

I live in Atlanta, GA, my hometown and the best city in the world.

I am a wife, a little sister, and a friend to some pretty cool people.
Here are just a few of them that also have websites:

- **Ryan Curtin**, my husband, machine learning researcher and adventure captain <http://ratml.org/>
- **Andy Freeman**, my big brother, music producer and mix engineer <http://andyfreemanaudio.com/>
- **Lindsay Thompson**, director of Travel Light <http://www.suchtalltales.com/>
- **Thalea Stokes**, classical bass, ethnomusicologist <http://chicago.academia.edu/ThaleaStokes>
- **Nathan Connelly**, storyboard artist for animation and D-list celebrity in Japan <http://nconnelly.com/>
- **Elaine Mayes**, photographer and mentor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Mayes>
- **Elizabeth Littauer**, virologist and lover of mountains <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth_Littauer>
- **Somi Cowan**, developer and digital artist <http://somiyoon.com/>
- **Rachel Lovins**, mezzo-soprano and missionary <https://rachellovins.wordpress.com/>
- **Chad Kersey**, computer architect and general enthusiast <http://www.cdkersey.com/>
- **And many, many more** that don't have websites I can list here

The others are ranchers, writers, doctors, nurses, teachers, artists of all sorts, developers, engineers, nerds, designers, athletes, chefs, baby whisperers, farmers, city-slickers, mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, good drivers, ok drivers, terrible drivers, people who don't like to dance and people who will dance the night away.
