The HokeyPokeyTree is a generic tree structure useful for many different applications.

The HokeyPokeyTree API gives users the ability to insert right child nodes, take right child nodes out,
insert right child nodes, and shake them all about. After insertion and removal and insertion of nodes,
the tree randomizes such that nodes are randomly assigned new parents and children.

Indeed, this is what it's all about.
