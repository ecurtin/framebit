    <p>I listened to a lot of Bowie during this project. It was roughly period appropriate.</p>

    <p>David Hockney is an artist who has dabbled in lots of different media and disciplines, from painting to stage
        design to, briefly and famously, photography.</p>

    <p>Though <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hockney#The_.22joiners.22">Wikipedia says</a> he eventually
        grew frustrated with the camera's single-eye approach to a scene, his efforts to compensate for it through
        collages and polaroid composites are well documented.</p>

    <p>While Hockney's compositions are created from many different images with all the quirks and subtleties of a human
        hand holding a 35mm or polaroid camera, my idea was to recreate the style of his collages and composites using a
        single source image.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.hockneypictures.com/photos/photos_collages.php">Hockney's collages</a> are composed of lots
        of photos of the same subject or same scene, layered and mixed and jumbled to give textural comment. <a
                href="http://www.hockneypictures.com/photos/photos_polaroids.php">The polaroid composites</a> are
        orderly layouts of polaroids taken of the same scene at different times and slightly different points.</p>

    <script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

    <p>To approach this, I built a custom library centered around the abstraction of ImageTiles. These are sub-images of
        the source file that have lots of different properties: show, don't show, zoom in, zoom out, bright, darken,
        emphasize, scatter, and room for lots more.</p>

    <p>After a semester spent mired mostly in C++ with a little Python, I took the liberty of doing this in Java, which
        was... really nice, actually. It was fun to be able to get ideas out without tripping over syntax. I will get
        around to learning Python properly someday, but that is not this day! The source code is here: <a
                href="https://github.com/ecurtin/PhotoCollage/">https://github.com/ecurtin/PhotoCollage/</a></p>

    <p>Using this custom library, which relied on some oldie but goodie and MUCH MORE NICELY FORMATTED code from my dear
        old writes-Java-like-its-70's-Fortran computer graphics professor, I built an application to make collages and
        an application to make composites.</p>

    <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/emilymaycurtin/24139061985/in/datetaken/"

                                 width="600" height="600" alt="BowieCollage"></a>
    <script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


    <p>The applications follow roughly the same format:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Input the image</li>
        <li>Split it into ImageTiles</li>
        <li>Pipe these imageTiles through a number of transformations including
            <ul>
                <li>Scatter: move the coordinates for where the tile will be rendered to a random location a random
                    distance away
                </li>
                <li>Show/Hide: For the collage, randomly show or hide the tile based on a density parameter</li>
                <li>Brighten/Darken: make the image randomly a little brighter or a little darker (I found a little goes
                    a looong way for this one)
                </li>
                <li>Zoom: randomly zoom the tile in or out.</li>
                <li>Others! It's super easy to write a method to do something to a single tile and simply add it in the
                    main run loop of the program.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

       title="strawberryComposite"><img class="center"
                                        src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1668/24030956762_e9f461e63a_b.jpg"

    <p>Bonus, although I haven't gotten around to it, this is embarrassingly parallel. I could speed this up IMMENSELY
        by generating a bunch of worker threads to each work on their own tile or small set of tiles.</p>

    <p>And speaking of things I haven't gotten around to yet, there's lot of room for improvement here, especially in
        the collage. A few ideas:</p>

    <p>To increase the analog or human jitter realism:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Different kinds of exposure modification beyond just lighten/darken</li>
        <li>Random rotation within a specified range</li>
        <li>Color distortion to simulate differences apparent in the chemical development process</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To further the aesthetic qualities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apply scatter based on heuristics instead of pure probability. Move in the direction of the gradient of the
            tile?
        </li>
        <li>Apply heuristics and/or computer vision techniques to detect interesting features and large swaths of
            similar space, emphasizing and de-emphasizing as appropriate (is de-emphasizing a word?)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To make the application more friendly/usable, since apparently nobody likes one-liner shell scripts with ~18
        anonymous numerical parameters</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An actual GUI! Something I haven't had to think about since I started doing Systems! Maybe github.io? Maybe just a .jar?</li>
        <li>Paralleliize (how on earth do you spell that?) for speed</li>
        <li>Perhaps an interface where the user can graphically select regions of interest as input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Finally, Professor Irfan Essa:</p>
